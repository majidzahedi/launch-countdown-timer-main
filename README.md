## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [react-spring](https://react-spring.dev/) - Animation for react
- [Moment js](https://momentjs.com/) - For handling time related things, because i'm lazy.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Using react-spring was new for me and i learned alot from it. i used to animate stuff with css but this lib make it lot easier.

### Useful resources

- [react spring flip](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-spring-flip-clock-demo-sz0gd?from-embed=&file=/src/components/flip-card/index.tsx) - This sandbox helped me with animation and components.
